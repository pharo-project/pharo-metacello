This repository is a fork from https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work.

IMPORTANT: the master must keep in sync with the origin repository. It can be used to do pull requests.

The pharo branch aims 
* to host tags of Metacello versions integrated into Pharo and
* to keep small changes related to Pharo that cannot be pushed to the original repository because of compatibility problems (Pharo 1.4 to current versions of Pharo, gemstone and squeak).
